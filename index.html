            <p>Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from Canada to southern Chile.[3] The potato
                was
                originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans independently in multiple
                locations,[4]
                but later genetic traced a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
                northwestern
                Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago, from a species in the
                Solanum brevicaule complex.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is
                indigenous,
                some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.</p>
